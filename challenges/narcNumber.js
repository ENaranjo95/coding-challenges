/*
A Narcissistic Number is a number which is the sum of its own digits, each
raised to the power of the number of digits.

Have the function narcNumber take in a number as a parameter and determine if it
is a Narcissistic Number. Your code must return true or false depending upon
whether the given number is a Narcissistic number.

Examples:
153:  1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 ... True
1634: 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634 ... True

let narcNumber = (value) => {

module.exports = narcNumber
